### Notes from docuemt:

- Leaders concerned that their IT Departments are not able to execute on changes that could impact business outcomes fast enough

- Realize that the business priority is going to change rapidly, Digitization opportunites quickly rise and fall, if IT can't execute with pace, the priority may be reduced for an effort that was important 3 months ago. It isn't just the fault of the business and their priorities. (OEM, we are approaching a year since this initiative was proposed and we are still in design phase.)

- **Key Features of the IT Operating Model**
  1. **Products over Projects:** Priorities and budgets are set for business capabilites and products, not projects.
  2. **Adaptive Business Engagement:** Business engagement approach flexes based on business context.
  3. **Agile, DevOps, Continuous Delivery:** Integrated delivery, engineering, and support boost responsiveness and output.
  4. **Customer-Centric Design:** Customer-journey mapping is used to guide design
  5. **Applications Building Blocks:** APIs, platforms, data, and reusable services reduce and accelerate delivery.
  6. **Cloud-Based Scalable Infrastructure:** IT Automation and cloud platforms cuts time to scale.
  7. **Strategy Over Governance, Management Over Operations:** Central Groups refocus on facilitating strategy, innovation, change, and enterprise data.
  8. **Data Strategy Over Ownership:** Coherent strategy and guidelines around data allow for rapid exploitation by distributed teams.
  9. **Adaptive Skills and Mindset:** Staff become technically versatile, collaborative, and open to innovation.
  

* **Product over Projects:**
  * Allocating budget to the product and not project allows product manager and teams to shift focus much faster when business needs change instead of having to go start another project and obtain funding.
  * Product Manager must be focused on continuously improving the product and working closely with customers and understanding business objectives
  * *State Farm opted to take a big swing and move everything to the product model, other organizations suggested taking a few product lines at a time to minimize risk.*
  * To be successful, visibility across product lines should be a **must**. Allows for sharing of innovation, identification of duplicity and managing interdependencies.
  
* **Adaptive Business Engagement**
  * IT and Business must work closer together. Business doesn't want to have to develop requirements and pass them to IT to respond/execute on. They want a colaborative experience with their IT partners to get strategic advice on digital opportunites and risks. 
  * IT Organizations need to be fleixble and adaptive to the business engagement, five activites that IT needs to be prepared to do **Evangelizing and educating, consulting, brokering, coaching and delivering - based on business partners' digital ambition and ability.** All teams need to have some form of business engagement, however one team cant execute on all 5 activites. This will be spread across different teams and can be a challenge due to talkent gaps.
    * **Evangelizing** - Keep abreast of emerging digital trends, and educate business partners on opportunities to create value from technology.
    * **Consulting** - Offer advice and frameworks to enable succesfful business leadership of technology investments.
    * **Brokering** - Provide the internal and external connections needed for business leadership of technology investments.
    * **Coaching** - Develop employee skills to help them make full use of the enterprise's technology and information.
    * **Delivering** - Own the process of delivering technology functionality, or provide integration capabilities for besiness-led technology investments.
  * The article mentions that 21% of business partners feel IT Provides effective advice. 
    - [ ] Can we measure this?
  * Understand your business partners technical aptitude to determine the engagement activites needed from IT.
  * Have the ability to build on-demand teams that can provide the right mix of knowledge and engagement based on business stakeholder requirements.
  * Build technical depth and engagement skills in parallel. A more flexible, team-oriented model for business engagement can’t work unless traditional engagement roles (e.g., business analysts) develop stronger technical knowledge and delivery teams build relationship management and influencing skills.

* **Agile, DevOps, Continuous Delivery**
  * Didn't capture notes from this section as there wasn't anything that jumped out as new. *Did add the action items below though*
  
* **Customer-Centric Design**
  * All about understanding the customers experience, identify the issues that create friction and use that information to make the design a better experience.
  * IT doesnt need to be involved in all Customer Experience. Identify the best areas for IT Involvement.
  * Look at customer expereince across business silos...
  * IT Needs access to real customers to change perspective.
  * State Farm used as the Case Study... Need to get access to this report!

* **Applications Building Blocks**
  * Lots of capabilites are accelerating ITs ability to integrate services and make them smaller and decoupled. APIs, microservices, containers and cloud are just a few.
  * Moving aware from territorial data ownership and having a strong enterprise data strategy that allows for sharing is a must to acheive these smaller building blocks.
  * Corporate IT must find the means to both speed and scale this boundary crossing without creating unnecessary complexity, effort, or risk.
  * API's and Selfserivce capabilites are not just for IT. Find ways to share this information with business and get the capabilites as close to where value is added as possible.
  * Intuit focuses on delivering APIs as its primary end product. This allows them to move away from end-to-end delivery of applications.

* **Cloud-Based Scalable Infrastructure**
  * Cloud enables new opportunities for IT. The ability to fully automate and support infrastrcutre as code and mininize capital expedintures through operational is huge. Pay for what you need, when you need it for as long as you need it. Historically, traditional data centers require a lot of expenditure before the infrasatructure is even used, long lead times to acquire the infrastrcture and lots of inneficiencies. When the project shutsdown or fails, you still have this huge expense. Failure is expensive in on-prem solutions.
  * Don't develop your cloud strategy in a silo. Work with your business partners to develop the strategy and see where cloud fits in business initiatives.
  * New projects/products should be the initial focus of the cloud. Migrating existing products will not provide the ROI as quickly as you would like.
  * DevOps is a must for cloud... Moving to the cloud without devops will not allow for the rapid deployment, testing and iteration that the cloud provides.
